Project Naukri.com Clone
Hello everyone! This blog is about my construct week project at Masai School.
I was assigned the Naukri.com website. It is a job search engine platform. Here job seekers can search for jobs and recruiters can hire fitting candidates.
Managing project expectations is a key skill for the success of a project. I tried to add all the functionality in my project same as the original. Delivering a clone of the assigned website within the scheduled time limit was my goal for this project.

This is the landing page of the cloned website.
I have built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I tried to replicate the appearance of the website. I used JavaScript to make the website functional and dynamic. I used CSS Flex layouts and Div layouts, which made a lot of things easier.
The implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the actual products was interesting and intriguing to learn such things.
